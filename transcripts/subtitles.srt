00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:04,415
if you're someone that believes you waste a lot of time or maybe you're just not

1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,432
productive enough maybe you don't get enough done maybe you're overthinking procrastinating or don't know how

2
00:00:10,592 --> 00:00:15,039
to make a plan this video is for you because I'm going to show you the

3
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:21,568
eight ways that I save more time make more time and create more with my time

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,295
let me ask you a question how many of you believe that you're good at multi-tasking

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,175
now studies show that only two percent of the world's population is actually able to multitask

6
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:39,743
and researchers say that when people here that they always assume that there in that two

7
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:45,055
percent maybe you're sitting there at home thinking the same thing the truth is most of

8
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,591
us are in the ninety-eight percent save researchers and therefore we have to focus on something

9
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:56,799
called single tasking or monit asking this is the idea that we focus on one thing

10
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:02,271
at a time this sounds counter-intuitive a lot of people say well if I'm doing less

11
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:07,328
things that's going to take more time the truth is when you focus on one thing

12
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:13,503
at one time not only does your productivity and your efficiency go up your fatigue goes

13
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,272
down and your stress goes down as well next time you get lost in that battle

14
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:23,903
of trying to do loads of different things at the same time press pause take a

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,952
step back take a breath and just focus on that one activity this applies to eating

16
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:34,496
it applies to driving it applies to texting it applies to speaking on the phone or

17
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:38,944
a zoom call just do that one thing a few years ago I read a study

18
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:45,279
that changed the way I live you can't be logical and creative at the same time

19
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:51,552
your brain and mind is using different faculties and different abilities to do different types of

20
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:57,407
tasks imagine your own meetings all day about numbers and data and analytics and all of

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,695
a sudden you're asked to do something creative maybe you write a speech or give a

22
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:06,879
presentation it can be really really difficult to switch from one side of your brain to

23
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:12,768
the other side in a matter of seconds with very little organizing and planning were literally

24
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:18,656
going like a pendulum swinging from one task to another which is requiring different parts of

25
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:22,848
our brain and the abilities that we have the way I solve this is that I

26
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:27,936
start every day by first writing down might to do list I look at all the

27
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:32,800
activities that I have to do now in the examples are given this video I've simplified

28
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:36,671
my task to make it easier but no could I do this with a lot more

29
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:41,343
detail you want to draw a line down the middle of the page on one side

30
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:46,111
of it right logical and on the other side of it right creative you now want

31
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:51,104
to plot and mark where these tasks on your to-do list to fit either in the

32
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:57,503
logical category or in the creative category the question you're asking yourself is is this task

33
00:02:57,695 --> 00:03:04,992
largely structured focused does it have certain boundaries is it quite a logical step by step

34
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:10,848
process or is this creative is it more of a brainstorm is it somewhere where you

35
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:16,447
need to feel free and express it after you've divided these tasks you now want to

36
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:21,567
write down the time estimate that that specific task is going to take what ends up

37
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:26,304
happening is you start to plot your week by saying Monday is going to be created

38
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:33,472
chooses a logical Wednesday's a logical those days are creative and Fridays our creative or you

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,768
may also divide your day into logical mornings and creative afternoons or creative mornings and logical

40
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:47,360
afternoons this division this time blocking allows you to get really immersed into the activity really

41
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:53,472
focus and be more productive and effective so this might be unpopular opinion but I live

42
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:59,007
by this and it has truly been a game changer in my world if it's not

43
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:04,735
in the calendar it won't get done it's not really a priority right you have to

44
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:09,440
make sure that it's in your plan it's in your day so I'm gonna show you

45
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:14,688
quickly what my calendar and schedule look like that is my life this month as you

46
00:04:14,783 --> 00:04:19,903
can see its color coded its beautifully designed and as I flick through this what you

47
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:27,231
realize is that every single day I have everything from workout time to meal times to

48
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:32,608
scheduled off time all in my calendar what this allows me to do is it helps

49
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:39,071
me prioritize both personal and professional commitments and helps me see both things in the same

50
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:44,063
place if you haven't put something in your calendar even if it's something social I promise

51
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:48,320
you you'll need to forget it or you won't plan effectively around it when I know

52
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:52,799
I have a really big podcast or a really big interview but if I know that

53
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:56,704
I have a big deadline on a day I don't then surround that day with other

54
00:04:56,864 --> 00:05:02,783
difficult and challenging tasks sometimes I'll start my day with the most challenging task of the

55
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,488
day because I feel that I need to start with the challenge and sometimes I actually

56
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,287
put it as the last most challenging task of the day because actually I want to

57
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:18,623
build that momentum when you have a schedule you get context around how you feel that

58
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:23,007
were you manage your mental health and well-being a million times better and you do more

59
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:23,936
with less time

60
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:30,783
tell me how many times you've experienced this you check everything off your to-do list but

61
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:38,880
you still feel unfulfilled you've used your time wisely you've managed to accomplish every task but

62
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:43,391
you still end the day when your head hits the pillow you still feel like you

63
00:05:43,488 --> 00:05:49,247
failed you still feel like you didn't quite achieve something I realized that this happened to

64
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:54,048
a lot of top performer and it was because they weren't asking themselves what do I

65
00:05:54,175 --> 00:06:00,671
need to do today that will make me feel like today has been a good day

66
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:04,575
you don't think that today is a good day because you did everything you wanted to

67
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,119
do you have to feel like it's been a good day so I do this activity

68
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:13,696
every single day where I ask myself the question what do I need to do today

69
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:17,760
that will make me feel like today has been a success for you it may be

70
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:22,623
reading your children a bedtime story it may be making sure that you made ten minutes

71
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:26,335
to meditate it may be that you have got to work out in or you had

72
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:32,032
your green juice it has to be something simple that's easily repeatable on a daily basis

73
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,503
but that you prioritize doing it writing down what you did every day gives you ideas

74
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,376
for the future as well and plotting it out in this way it makes it really

75
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,111
really simple to remember what you could try on another day how many of you feel

76
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:50,399
like the months or just passing by and it's crazy to believe that were over a

77
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:55,424
quarter of the way through the year but this is what happens when we don't have

78
00:06:55,584 --> 00:07:02,208
really clear goals targets and tasks this approach has really helped me manage my time better

79
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:10,048
I have big monthly goals I have for weekly targets and I have one daily task

80
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:16,511
the one daily task is the baby step towards the weekly target and the weekly target

81
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:21,471
added up or four of them leads to the big monthly goal so what you're doing

82
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:28,127
here in essence is breaking down something that feels quite unachievable impossible to do and quite

83
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:33,696
challenging into small manageable chunks sometimes you can be sitting there thinking wow I don't know

84
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:37,216
how I'm gonna get that done by the end of this month if you've ever felt

85
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:42,303
that way use this model first come up with how can you break that big girl

86
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:48,191
down into four separate tasks once you have these four weekly targets now only need to

87
00:07:48,256 --> 00:07:53,920
do is divide each weekly target into a daily task so basically you end up working

88
00:07:54,015 --> 00:08:00,832
on something daily that you achieve weekly which helps you achieve something monthly now you've completely

89
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:08,864
deconstructed this impossible unachievable idea into something very simple and manageable now I know I said

90
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:14,368
to you earlier that you should focus on single tasking not multi-tasking but here's a way

91
00:08:14,656 --> 00:08:18,272
that you can actually get more out of the same time I learned this from a

92
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:23,712
good friend Arianna Huffington who speaks about habit stacking now we all have habits in our

93
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:28,608
life that we do every single day without even thinking about it we're driving around town

94
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:33,536
where cooking every single day we may be on a walk these are great times to

95
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:38,528
immerse in those activities for sure when you're driving to be fully present if you're going

96
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:42,591
on a hype to be really there with in nature and if you're cooking to be

97
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:46,783
really present with the sense the sounds and and all of the different colors that may

98
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:46,943
be

99
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:53,856
but if you're someone who can do some of those things pretty comfortably you can also

100
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:58,047
add a stack of a habit so for example you may be someone who listens to

101
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:02,304
an audio book while driving you may be someone that listens to a podcast while cooking

102
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:06,528
or while you're on a hike or walking the dog it's okay to have it stack

103
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:10,943
in those scenarios to get more out of the same amount of time I've heard about

104
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:17,695
this in my book it's called location has energy time has memory when you do something

105
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:23,776
in the same place every day at the same time every day that space birds and

106
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,864
energy and that time Bode's in memory what does that mean when you've done something in

107
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,504
one place like meditated in the same place for a considerable amount of time that space

108
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:39,648
takes on a meditative energy and frequency it becomes easier to do that activity in that

109
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:44,607
place and similarly when you do something at the same time every day that time has

110
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:51,296
a memory your body your mind remember that and therefore it becomes easier to do divide

111
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,424
your home even in corners I remember when my wife and I lived in a five

112
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:00,864
hundred square for the partner and literally every corner of that room was divided into a

113
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:08,000
meditation corner a social corner a work corner and an eating corner even that differentiation allowed

114
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:12,736
you to keep the energy of that space sacred and appropriate for what you want to

115
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:18,208
do the challenge today is we eat what we're meant to sleep we sleep where were

116
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:22,815
meant to work and we work where were meant to eat so we've confused the energy

117
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:26,719
of our environment that's why we're sitting in bed and can't sleep because we do so

118
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:32,000
many different activities then remove that energy from the bedroom place it where it needs to

119
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:37,536
be and allow yourself to see how you use your time more effectively in that place

120
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,968
a lot of people think sleep is a waste of time I don't getting good quality

121
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:49,375
sleep is integral to making more out of the time you have when you're awake I

122
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:53,791
consistently sleep for eight hours a night and I'm really really happy about it because I

123
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:58,559
know that it allows me to perform better mentally and physically throughout the day one of

124
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,848
the things I will add though is that you want to be sleeping before midnight the

125
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:08,671
sleep before midnight is extremely powerful and is really critical for the hts the human growth

126
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:14,080
hormone to be activated so if you're sleeping a nine pn and you're getting those three

127
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:19,776
hours before midnight that's extremely powerful or even to if you're sleeping at ten PSO getting

128
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:24,864
seven to nine hours of sleep and it is critical to being productive with your time

129
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:29,119
when you are awake don't fall into that trap of that habit to believe that you

130
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:32,960
should be sleeping less to do more with your time a lot of the tips of

131
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:37,984
shared today are things that I learned from an incredible book by Daniel Levitan called the

132
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:43,424
organized mind I recently dive back into it using the blankest app to look at the

133
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,544
blinks that they had around the critical lessons that you can learn from this phenomenal book

134
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:53,088
you can also listen to these blinks as well that makes it really easy to digest

135
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:57,823
and remember I love that everything I loved about this book was captured in the blinks

136
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:03,296
and that it made it really easy to synthesize how I could turn these lessons into

137
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:09,088
a practical steps right now blankest has a special offer just for our audience go to
