00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:06,303
I compounded every science-based tools and techniques that angry Huberman talks about in his podcast and

1
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:10,272
made a simple routine I follow the routine for fourteen days and give you some insights

2
00:00:10,336 --> 00:00:13,855
on my experience at the end of this video I'll also guide you on a freak

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,304
notion them played on which you can edit and structure your routine back by neuroscience to

4
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:25,440
optimize your day and you Huberman is a neuroscientist and an associate professor from Stanford university

5
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:32,032
you create some awesome podcast about productivity look mean maximize them are true parental at lyricism

6
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:36,863
and very useful self or corning had been watched a lot of his videos on Europe

7
00:00:37,023 --> 00:00:41,855
and made notes for later use after reviewing all the things he mentioned and doing a

8
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:46,304
little bit of research on my own end I decided I would follow everything that Andrew

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,799
habermann suggests the neurologically write to him to follow to get all the cognitive benefits without

10
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:57,919
using any supplements in simple words brain hacking without nootropics

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,200
before we move forward I would like to undress that each and every action of this

12
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:08,959
routine is based on handy hooperman podcast and has a scientific reason for it science based

13
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:10,111
tools for everyday life

14
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:18,239
and for the sake of simplicity have compounded the routine into three major categories those are

15
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:20,351
morning phase one and face to

16
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:23,136
so let's start with the morning

17
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:29,919
so I just woke up right now that time is five forty am it's really dark

18
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:34,847
outside so let's turn on the lights and now I'm gonna go and write down my

19
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:36,447
wake up then I study

20
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:44,736
the reason for writing down the wake up time every day is to figure out the

21
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:49,632
temperature minimum of our body most of the time is just to us before our average

22
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:55,167
pickup time this will help us to pick a specific time to do hard mental work

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,279
in the day more on that in a while

24
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:08,895
it's weird to drink salt orderly in the morning it's not taste the end little

25
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:10,720
whatever

26
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:17,983
it is veered to drink salt water early in the morning but neurons transfers signals Canadians

27
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:24,128
from one into other through ionic conduction sodium is the main salt which helps the flow

28
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:29,151
of tions so adding some salt in a glass of water helps all neurons to wake

29
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:31,776
up and function properly early in the morning

30
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,832
usually I like to bring some black coffee the moment I wake up but Andrew says

31
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:50,688
having caffeine only in the morning can lead to an energy dip during afternoon also called

32
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:56,895
the afternoon crash and we may feel for the and tired therefore craving more caffeine more

33
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:57,567
coffee

34
00:02:59,776 --> 00:03:04,703
caffeine is best after ninety to one twenty minutes of waking up so yeah I'm going

35
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:09,664
to refrain from that and meanwhile do some meditation and listen to an audio look the

36
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:16,384
more a person asks questions practices figuring out answers and trains their ability to think the

37
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:21,727
better they will actually be able to think all right so it's past ninety minutes and

38
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:26,912
I can't resist Catherine anymore so I'm gonna bring some coffee and get ready for some

39
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,408
self generated forward ambulation

40
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:31,520
I'll tell you what that means

41
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:42,143
cells generated forward ambulation it's just a fancy turn to say I'm gonna go for a

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,679
walk or maybe run

43
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:53,311
when we move our body it generates I moved and causes optical flow which is good

44
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:58,496
for the nervous system and it activates many parts of our brain meanwhile lowering the functions

45
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:04,384
of amygdala to build better entrance he suggests to take him to in his with short

46
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,024
bursts and then following that with a long exhale so when you're at a steady cadence

47
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:11,360
and you're feeling good do double inhales

48
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:20,447
while you're running double inhale exhale double inhale exhale is a terrific way to breathe while

49
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:26,720
you're an ongoing effort apart from activating various parts of our brain and building endearments it's

50
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:31,967
also important to see sunlight early in the morning to signal the neurons that its data

51
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:36,608
and it's time for us to be more alert then the neuron said a huge domino

52
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:38,976
effect on all of our body organs

53
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:47,743
all right so we are done with are running and after this I'm gonna go to

54
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:51,679
the gym this may be a lot of physical activity for me but you know I

55
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:58,432
follow David Gauguin's I'd like to stay on drew the hydration Killick your mother eclipse your

56
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:03,231
legs are all sewer if I guess since places stress fractures no you don't you got

57
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:08,671
sore fucking legs get on your head they are speaking of David gorgons I'm currently following

58
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,704
this us navy seal work out which I'm gonna make a video little this video is

59
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:16,640
all about Andy Huberman so let's get this work out done and I'll meet you and

60
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:17,536
I'm back from the gym

61
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:29,536
all right some back from the gym and now I'm gonna take a cold shower really

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,727
good and then start my work from around ten or so let's go

63
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:44,127
cold water treatment could increase our dopamine level in a healthy and natural

64
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:51,839
while I take a shower let me tell you about the linear face this phase of

65
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:56,895
the day is for repetitive and analytical tasks this phase will pay more attention to the

66
00:05:56,992 --> 00:06:02,720
mind by following good practices based on a treaty and rhythm of the day basically all

67
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:07,519
radion rhythm is to work for nine minutes and rest for twenty minutes work for ninety

68
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:11,584
minutes to rest for twenty minutes it will help us to do many sessions of fulcra

69
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,855
deep work without feeling exhausted

70
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:26,111
these days everyone is doing intermittent fasting for weight loss and burning more fat but and

71
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:32,511
you puts emphasis on how fasting could increase our epinephrine and dopamine levels and focus more

72
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,328
on our work apart from burning tremendous amounts of fats fasting could increase our focus and

73
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:46,687
attention by increasing adrenaline epinephrine is made by the dopamine molecule the more the dopamine molecule

74
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,704
works the more motivated and driven we are towards doing a certain task the rays of

75
00:06:52,832 --> 00:07:00,223
dopamine and epinephrine all together increases focus attention motivation and gives us the driving energy to

76
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,279
work for are

77
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,671
so this is the part where the temperature minimum comes to played the best time to

78
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:17,503
do deep work is after four to six hours of my temperature minimum so if I

79
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:22,175
wake up at five thirty am my temperature minimum would be free three him and the

80
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:25,376
best time for me to do some deep work would be

81
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,447
after nine thirty is so right now it's ten him and let's start our the accession

82
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,951
our body's internal temperature rises from the time be baker so what we're trying to do

83
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:43,584
is sketch that steep temperature rise and optimize are ninety minutes of deep work in a

84
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,183
way this will allow us to do the most mentally challenging and intense world early in

85
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,528
the day and also and you suggest to get into ultra deep work by turning on

86
00:07:54,687 --> 00:08:00,671
airplane mode avoiding all kinds of distractions and listen to some low level white noise while

87
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:03,391
world to increase our focus and concentration

88
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:09,984
white noise has been shown to really enhance brain states for learning actually can have a

89
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:15,903
detrimental effect on auditory learning and maybe even the development of the auditory system in very

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,343
young children in particular in infants he also talks about bunch of other beets and noises

91
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:25,888
but it really comes down to personal preference and for me I like to switch bitten

92
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:30,496
binaural beets and white noise depending on the mood and type of work I'm getting into

93
00:08:31,264 --> 00:08:35,455
all right so we are done with her ninety minutes of deep world and I'm a

94
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:40,736
bit hungry right now but I'm not gonna eat tell to pm because I'm fasting and

95
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:43,968
that must be my order hold on a sec

96
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,719
for look what I got here

97
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:50,400
get a bomb at a bar

98
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:58,591
to boost fastings effects even more and you suggest to drink by Mary it's a special

99
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:05,023
Kennedy grown in Argentina and has more caffeine than regularly it could increase focus and post

100
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:05,888
fat burning

101
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,744
all right so I made some year by Mary and don't ask me how I made

102
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:12,351
it because

103
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:20,640
so the reason behind that nervous laughter is because yerba matter is not made like this

104
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,695
traditionally it's made in a part and its consumed through a metallic straw while pulling sips

105
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,088
of water over but you know it's my first day I'm learning

106
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:38,047
so the next thing in phase one is to learn something so I listen to an

107
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,247
Audi book for about thirty to forty minutes and while I listened to the holy book

108
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:44,447
I look outside the window and put in that I'm a main character in a movie

109
00:09:44,895 --> 00:09:50,432
where the main character is learning something that will drastically change his life

110
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:59,039
yeah that's about right but all jokes aside when we try to multitask we are not

111
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:04,064
getting any real benefit from any of the activities so it's important to not do any

112
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:08,864
mental tasks while listening to an audio book so that our focus is an diverted and

113
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:14,111
we could concentrate more on listening and believe it or not but looking outside the window

114
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:20,192
while listening to audiobook has helped me to become more present and retain more information from

115
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:20,864
the audiobook

116
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:29,247
all right so it's time for lunch and and so angry right now I'm so relieved

117
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:36,671
to see food I'm having a protein shake some chicken breasts salad and some brown rice

118
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,088
keeping it on the lord side because they can in starch and then and starchy foods

119
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:47,520
make us feel sleepy however carbs are still needed for recovery from workout and physical exertion

120
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:52,096
so adding some amounts as useful as long as it doesn't make us feel the Tajik

121
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,567
so regardless of having less cob's in my lunch I still feel kind of sleepy so

122
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:05,856
yeah I'm gonna take a quick nap right now and then talk to you after thirty

123
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:11,807
to forty minutes good night but and you got a better solution than just maps and

124
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:17,504
that is to do in SDR enis de stands for non sleep depressed it is a

125
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:23,711
technique of giving our body proper rest without actually sleeping it works by listening to a

126
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:28,416
guided meditation and focusing on their voice and following each and every step

127
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:37,151
that was great it was like my body is hypnotized and I don't want to move

128
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:41,471
my arms or legs and in the video ends I feel so refreshed right now and

129
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:42,015
SDR

130
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:48,575
I'm gonna do in star from now I suggest you try and SDR yourself whenever you

131
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:49,536
want to take a nap

132
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:56,640
from here starts face to okay the nonlinear face the face when we are the most

133
00:11:56,736 --> 00:12:01,952
creative throughout the day nonlinear face starts after seven to nine hours of taken up is

134
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:05,823
the best time to get into creative world and brainstorm ideas

135
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:15,296
all right so it's three pm right now and like earlier I'm gonna turn on airplane

136
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:20,512
mode on my phone and add to debug sessions for this time one will be from

137
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:25,408
three pm to four thirty pm and I'll take thirty minutes of rest and then I'll

138
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,375
start the second one which will be from five pm to six thirty be after six

139
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,567
thirty pm we'll head out to see some light and I'll tell you how that will

140
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:38,495
help us to have better sleep and follow the circadian rhythm of the day so let's

141
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,695
turn on some white noise in the background and get to work

142
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:08,288
this video has been interrupted by me if you're enjoying the konen so far then I

143
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:12,351
would really really appreciate you if you hit the light button as your like is very

144
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:17,952
valuable to me and this channel is all about learning new things and sharing the experience

145
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:23,424
with visual storytelling so if you're interested in that subscribe to my channel for more or

146
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,208
some going in like this all right back to face to

147
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:34,591
as I've been sitting around for the whole day going out will help me to feed

148
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:39,359
my brain with some variety you feel my energy simply with the mood also if I

149
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:44,768
could manage to meet up with my friends will increase my energy as social connections increase

150
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:50,176
baseline dopamine by a large factor another reason for going out and seeing some evening light

151
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:54,559
is because it's a line with the circadian cycle of the day it's a cycle that

152
00:13:54,624 --> 00:14:00,799
repeats every twenty four hours and is dependent on the surrounding of an organism light and

153
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:07,552
dark are the two major factors that affect the circadian cycle we sleep wake up it

154
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,960
feel tired and do everything based on the circadian rhythm of the day so if we

155
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:18,208
figure out circadian rhythm and make it work for us then we had a sleep cycle

156
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:23,840
therefore it was important aspect to wake up and do forward ambulation so that our brain

157
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:28,960
reacts to light and activates all parts of our brain and body and at the evening

158
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:34,335
I'm seeing the sun setting following with darkness it will be easier for me to transition

159
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:40,000
tonight mode and fall asleep better and with that being said we were moving on to

160
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,088
our final lap

161
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:48,736
so it's the final phase now and that is to follow good practices for better sleep

162
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:53,151
I don't pay much attention to my sleep I often sleep for six hours and you

163
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:55,392
can clearly see that by my dark circles

164
00:14:57,056 --> 00:15:03,583
so let's follow good practices for sleeping and have a good night's sleep number one elevating

165
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:09,695
your feet with a pillow number two keeping the room dark and chill so let's turn

166
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:15,168
on the air conditioner number three is wearing an eye mask if you cannot keep the

167
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:21,471
room dark so it will not be needed here number for taking a hot shower before

168
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:26,943
bed I'll not be doing this because today I'm already feeling sleepy I'll try this on

169
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:34,208
other days and number five is to inhale and exhale deeply while on with that sounded

170
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:40,096
wrong but carrying forward finally he talks about how important it is to breed from your

171
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:45,888
nose while you're sleeping he recommends to apply some medicinal tape and it can also prevent

172
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:49,919
snoring not that I snore I just want to breathe from my nose that's

173
00:15:54,111 --> 00:16:00,351
so I've completed fourteen days of following andry humans routine and honestly I just feel great

174
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:04,960
like no kidding these past few days have been so much fun and I feel a

175
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:09,343
lot energetic than my usual sense the year by Mary is doing stuff to me and

176
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:13,695
I didn't even prepare it the traditional way I'm thinking of buying a Marty and prepare

177
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:18,624
it in the right way like the Argentineans do and get high with no but seriously

178
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:23,392
I'm enjoying my year by Mary I'm enjoying my fasting I don't feel much hungry nowadays

179
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:27,359
which is super good if you want to lose weight and maintain a healthy lifestyle and

180
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:31,455
avoid all junk food and stuff and sometimes I even forget to eat lunch like it's

181
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:32,992
three pm and then I remember

182
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:39,872
a ship I have to eat lunch now let's talk about the work aspect like listening

183
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,064
to white music and manorial beats while working it has helped me a lot to focus

184
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,616
on one thing and do the hard mental work early in the day I'm not like

185
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,544
one of those guys who could study for six to era straight I'm like let's study

186
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,911
then chill then let's still more so for me blocking my time into ninety minutes of

187
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:03,007
work and twenty minutes of rest and following that throughout the day has helped me a

188
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,767
lot so these past few days have been amazing I feel really an elder day but

189
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:14,112
at the same instant fourteen days is very less amount of time to conclude anything but

190
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:18,784
you know I still like it I really like how Andy your bermans takes complex subjects

191
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,647
and make it really easy to understand for us common people who are not so wise

192
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:28,895
in the ways of science so as promised have attached the link to the routine and

193
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:33,280
it's completely free you just have to make a account on notion if you don't have

194
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:38,495
one for each major section of the routine have attached links to and you bermans podcast

195
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:41,567
and research that bad the performed action

196
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:48,447
and finally I want to say if you're someone who listens to Andrew Huberman podcast and
